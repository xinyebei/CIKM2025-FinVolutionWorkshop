# FinVolution Data Science Competition Workshop
### Deepfake Face Detection Challenge
##### Held in conjunction with CIKM'25, November 14, 2025, Seoul, Korea

## INTRODUCTION
The objective of this workshop is to discuss the winning submissions of the FinV Data Science Competition 2025 Challenge on Deepfake Face Detection and related topics. 
As synthetic media becomes more widespread and sophisticated, the ability to accurately detect manipulated visual content is increasingly vital, especially in areas such as finance, cyber security, and digital platforms. In this challenge, We provided a large-scale datasets comprising hundreds of thousands of facial forgery detection images. Compared to existing similar competitions, this challenge places greater emphasis on the cross-domain generalization capability of algorithms. Specifically, the competition has assessed the ability of algorithms to adapt to application data distributions that differ from those encountered during training and to accurately detect forged facial images generated by unknown forgery techniques.
